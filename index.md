# Android Integrity Alliance - FAQ

## What is the Android Integrity Alliance?  
The Android Integrity Alliance is a global movement advocating for user rights, sustainability, and fairness in the Android ecosystem. Our focus is to address restrictive practices like those implemented through Google's Play Integrity API, which limit device and software freedom, increase e-waste, and undermine user control.

## What is Google Play Integrity?  
Google Play Integrity is an API that developers can use to verify the trustworthiness of the app and device environment where their apps run. It uses signals like hardware-backed boot integrity, app licensing, and Play Protect certification to determine whether a device or app meets specific standards.

---

## Why is Google Play Integrity a problem?  
Google Play Integrity becomes problematic because it:  
- **Discriminates against custom ROM users**: Devices with unlocked bootloaders or uncertified firmware fail checks, regardless of their security or functionality.  
- **Reduces sustainability**: Custom ROMs, which help extend the life of devices, are penalized, pushing users toward buying new devices unnecessarily.  
- **Limits user freedom**: It enforces proprietary hardware-backed checks that prioritize Google-certified ecosystems, restricting alternative development and customization.  
- **Potentially violates competition laws**: Such restrictions may conflict with regulations like the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which encourages fair competition and interoperability.

---

## What is the goal of this movement?  
Our goal is to:  
1. Advocate for fair and open practices that protect user freedom and competition.  
2. Push regulatory bodies to scrutinize and address anti-competitive practices.  
3. Collaborate with stakeholders, including custom ROM developers and ethical device manufacturers, to promote a sustainable and user-friendly Android ecosystem.

## Who benefits from this movement?  
- **Users**: Gain more freedom and control over their devices.  
- **Developers**: Enjoy a fairer environment with fewer barriers to innovation.  
- **The environment**: Reduced e-waste through extended device lifespans enabled by custom ROMs.  
- **The market**: Promotes healthy competition, fostering a more diverse and open ecosystem.

## What is the long-term vision of the Android Integrity Alliance?  
Our vision is an Android ecosystem where:  
- Users have full control over their devices and software choices.  
- Sustainable practices like custom ROM usage are encouraged, not penalized.  
- Competition thrives, allowing alternatives to Google's ecosystem to flourish.

We leverage a multi-faceted approach:  
1. **Legal advocacy**: Identifying and challenging potential violations of regulations like the DMA.  
2. **Collaboration**: Partnering with organizations, developers, and ethical manufacturers impacted by these policies.  
3. **Grassroots action**: Mobilizing users to raise awareness and amplify our cause through petitions, campaigns, and media outreach.  
4. **Expertise**: Engaging legal, technical, and policy experts to strengthen our position and propose solutions.  

Together, we can create a more inclusive and sustainable Android ecosystem.
